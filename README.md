# Vlox

Vlox it's an extra (aka plugin) designed to work with the [CMS MODX](https://modx.com/) to integrate VueJS and let you 
easily create digital experiences in a simple and straightforward way.

By integrating a powerful development framework focused on content management, and Vue, you'll get most of the complex 
functionalities, like security management, webservices, out of the box, while being free to build any kind of user 
interface interactions that you can imagine.

## Using vlox

You'll need a [MODX installation](https://docs.modx.com/current/en/getting-started/installation), if you want, you can
dive into the MODX documentation, or just use the docker configuration that we have to launch a fully working 
infrastructure.

[Here](https://github.com/Trotalo/modxBaseEnviroment/blob/master/README.md) you can find details on how to set up 
a docker configuration on W10 using WSL2

1. Run the following command `git clone git@github.com:Trotalo/modxBaseEnviroment.git yourProjectName` DON'T forget
to update the `yourProjectName` value
2. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and set the `YOUR_IP` to your local ip address
3. Enter yourProjectName folder, and execute the command `docker-compose up`
4. Go for a coffee, depending on your connection this can take some time, as mysql and apache services are being 
downloaded and configured
5. Once you see `AH00094: Command line: 'apache2 -D FOREGROUND'` in the console, the service will be up and running.
6. Open `https://YOUR_IP` on your browser, and you should see the MODX welcome page
7. Click the ***Go to the manager*** big green button
8. Enter the manager using admin/admin as credentials

At this point you can install vlox in 2 possible ways, first you can just install the extra and start developing 
your site, or you can configure the project to develop new features or view the vlox code.

17. Now we need to install the PHP dependencies, for this you need to retrieve the name of the docker container, for 
run `docker ps`
18. You should see an entry similar to `yourprojectname_web_1` with the name you assigned, copy that entry
19. Update the **yourprojectname** value and run the following command, this will run composer inside the container
and install the dependencies
`docker exec -ti yourprojectname_web_1 sh -c "cd /var/www/html/vlox/core/components/vlox/controllers && composer install"`
